/*

What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
I learned that when you use the for in loop, the key you use does not take the full properties
of the object itself. It will only take the value and not the whole object as a whole. That is why
we had to call object[key], because we needed the information in the object.

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
Usin the for in loop really helped, as well as the sort function which was looked online to help.
The sort function is a little confusing but from what I can understand it is going through
and comparing values and placing them in a way where it is sorting them, in this instance from highest
to lowest.

What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
I feel like I can iterate through nested objects in JavaScript.
