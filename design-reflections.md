What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The site's primary goal is to show the content of my projects and show me as a person for future emoployers. The content the site will feature are my information, past projects, and other information about me through links and social media.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audiences interest is looking for an employer. My site addresses them by showing my strengths and capabilities of what I can do

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
There are different actions one can take when on the site. I would like them to see my portfolio as well as contaccting me. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The main points to know about design are that it is not as wasy as it sounds. It takes many redos and patience. User experience is just what it says, the way a user experiences a system. There are more possibilities when it comes to user experience and there is no one right answer. 

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is the design in which the user feels most comfortable so that it is easy for them. It is valuable because if the user does not like the design there won't be many users.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The most tedious part of this challenge would be planning the site-map that I have to come up with. I felt like this is the hardest part for me.
