# 1.1 Think about Time Reflection
I learned to pace myself when it comes to time management. This is important because I don't want to give myself all the time in the world to work onan assignment and just waste all that time stressing over it. If I give myself little time and use timebox I can assess my progress and work thorugh the assignments. I can easily emplot this tool because it will be less stress on me and more understanding what I need to do nxt and what I need to do to change what I have been doing in order to get what I want to finish. As of now I usually give myself too much time and end up procrastinating until the very end. In a way my strategy has been workin for me, but it is not the best way to go about things.

Timebox is a period of time when a goal will be worked on. In a group sense it is agreed upon. Work will stop at the agreed time and then discussed what was accomplished and what needs to change if the task was not finished. It is useful in group work and individual use to manage time effectively.  

My plan for phase 0 is to give myself little chunks at a time to work. Take a break from it, work on other things, exercise and go back to it to see it from a different perspective. If I work at it in small doses I feel like I can work at it more so than I normally do with my previous time. 

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a user interface to access the operating computer's system services. "Bash" is a type of shell used in unix. It is also the language used in the command line. The most challenging thing for me was to get away from my typical use of interface to get used to typing everything. I was also used to just clicking on everything from a graphical perspective so getting used to the command line took some time. I was able to use all the commands successfully, though not right away at first. I think the most important commands to use are how to navigate through the command line (such as cd, cd.., mkdir, rmdir, ls, pwd) in order to know where you are and how to get through your directories. 

Pwd - stands for print working directory. It shows you the current directory you are working in also where you are in the command line

ls - lists every file and directories in the current directory you are in

mv - moves an object to another place. It can also me used to rename directories in needed as well as coping them

cd - is used to change directories. If written cd.. it takes you back one directory

../ - the backslash is used to denote a directory 

touch - creates a new file

mkdir - makes a new directory

less - shows you the content of a file

rmdir - removes a directory. If just written as rm you can remove a file as well

help - gives you all the help options located in the terminal/command line



# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

In order to create a new repo you need to click on the new repo button on your git hub. To fork a repo you would need to go to the repo and there is a button that says fork. Once you click on that that repo will be forked to your account. Cloning a repo requires to use the command line and use the git command git clone and the url the repo you want to clone. Cloning makes it easier so you can access it directly on your computer as opposed to having to access it online. Forking a repo is easier than making a new one because you don't have to start new and you can add and write you own additions to your own forked copy. Some struggles I had with setting up git was actually having it work on my command line. I needed to make sure the administrator settings were in effect so I can actually use them. I learned how to fork and clone repositories. It is very easy to understand and it will be helpful in the near future.
