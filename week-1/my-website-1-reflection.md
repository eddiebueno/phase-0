Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on github, you need to go to your profile then click repositories and then new. This will lead you to a screen where you will need to title it, make it public or private, and then give it a license. Once you have made it you can clone it to your local computer. To do this you ned to go on the command line and and type git clone [http] where [http] is the link to the new repository you made. This will then clone that repository to your local computer.

Describe what open source means.
Open source is the practice of sharing how a program was made and allow anyone to customize the program as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I feel like open source is amazing. It allows so much access to many different applications. However there can be many problems as someone who has taken this open source and used it to sell or gain a benefit out of it. This can lead to legal problems that shouldn't happen but people can not always see what the right thing to do is. I feel somewhat verous about it, because it wants me to be cautious of all my code that upload. In a sense it can help so many people see different ways code is written. This can lead to more code written and more ways code can be used.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses is really important because it gives the creater the rigths nccessary to claim it as their own. Without it anyone can just steal code from someone else and claim it as their own and also possibly make a profit out of it. It protects the creator and the user.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
During this challenge I was able to push and pull a lot easier than I did in the previous challenge. I remembered what I did but I also had to look some things up to fully get what it was I was doing. I mostly struggled with understanding the different branches aspect and really understanding what to do with push and pull.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I used this website: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
it basically outlines anything and everything you can do with git.
