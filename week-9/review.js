What concepts did you solidify in working on this challenge? 
I solidified objects in js

What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
I think the most difficult part was that I needed to not think like ruby and try to go at this problem in js.

Did you solve the problem in a new way this time?
I think I went about the problem the same way

Was your pseudocode different from the Ruby version? What was the same and what was different?
It was the same.
