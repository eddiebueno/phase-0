How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can use it to see what everything looks like and what position everything is in. You can literally play around with it to make sure you get the right element in the right place that you want it to be in.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements by using width(which changes the width),height(which changes the height), and other ones that alter one or both dimensions at a time.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
 The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor(non static).

 Fixed is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

 Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

 An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

The easiest to use was static because it literally just staye din it's place without moving.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I loved that it was challenging. I hated it that it took so long. It is super tedious when this is all new to you. When you play around with this an get used to it, it will definitely get easier.
