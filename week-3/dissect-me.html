	        How does git help you keep track of changes?<br>
	        Git helps you keep track of changes by the use of commits. Commit lets you save instances of your code when you have changed it. You write a description of it that is short and precise to let you know what has been changed.

	        Why use GitHub to store your code?<br>
	        You would want to use github to store your code because it is collaborative friendly. You can share your code with other users easy. It also lets you save your code online so when you work on your code loacally on your computer, you can look at the differences when you uploda them to github. This helps in case there are bugs with the new code you have added or changed.

<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
<!DOCTYPE html> - Telling a compiler or other program that this is in fact an html file. 
<html> - an html tag. 
<head> - has all the important information that is not visable. 
<meta charset="utf-8"> - sets the characters that are being used, this one in particular is the most common used one. 
<article> - a tag that is usually what can take up the whole page, like an actual artical. 
<h1> - describes the most important heading on the page. 
<section> - a tag that determines that there is a subsection of the page. 
<p> - a tag that means it is a different paragraph. 

All of these are useful and will probably be  used in the future. The more important ones would be the doctype html and head as those are the ones that have to be on every html file. These other ones do not neccessary have to be there. You can use div for all the others if you want. These are there just to make the code look cleaner and nicer.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements get laid on the page from top to bottom and from parent to child. So the code is looked at from the top first. This is why all the important information is listed on top.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned Sublime has a lot of neat shortcuts that I have not played with yet. I will try to create more snippets as they will definitely come in handy. I need to research more shortcuts so that I can code more efficiently than how I am now.
